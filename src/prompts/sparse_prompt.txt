Go through this transcript and produce concise action minutes for this meeting. Focus ONLY on:

1. Actions taken (votes, approvals, adoptions, appointments)
2. Motions made (including who made and seconded them)
3. Vote results
4. Presentations or reports delivered
5. Basic descriptions of agenda items (1-2 sentences max)

For each item, ALWAYS include specific segment references using the format [seg_X] or [seg_X-Y] for ranges. These segment references are CRITICAL for verifying information in the transcript.

Do NOT include:
- Detailed discussions
- Back-and-forth conversations 
- Questions and answers
- Personal opinions of members
- Lengthy explanations

Format your response like formal action minutes:

1. CALL TO ORDER (time, who called it) [seg_X]
2. ROLL CALL/ATTENDANCE (who was present) [seg_X-Y]
3. For each agenda item:
   a. Item title and very brief description [seg_X-Y]
   b. If a presentation occurred, note who presented [seg_X-Y] (without presentation details)
   c. For public comments, simply note if there were any and who spoke [seg_X-Y]
   d. For actions: "Motion By [Name] [seg_X], Second By [Name] [seg_X], To [action]"
   e. Vote results: "Motion [approved/failed] ([vote count])" [seg_X-Y]

The minutes should be official-looking, sparse, and focused only on actions and decisions made during the meeting, not on discussions or deliberations. For agenda items and actions, please give a detailed description of the items based on the info in the agenda. Use official terminology and language wherever possible. Don't be excessively brief for example feel free to include people's full names. For consent agenda, please be as detailed as possible (use bullet points instead of a flat list/paragraph).

Always include segment references for verification.
Use your judgment to format the document appropriately based on the type of meeting and organization. Don't clump together multiple agenda items in a single section. And prefer heirarchial bullet points over a flat list/paragraph.
