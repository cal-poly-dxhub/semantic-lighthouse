Go through this transcript and produce concise action minutes for this meeting. Focus ONLY on:

1. Actions taken (votes, approvals, adoptions, appointments)
2. Motions made (including who made and seconded them)
3. Vote results
4. Presentations or reports delivered
5. Basic descriptions of agenda items (1-2 sentences max)

For each item, ALWAYS include specific segment references using the format [seg_X] or [seg_X-Y] for ranges. These segment references are CRITICAL for verifying information in the transcript.

Do NOT include:
- Detailed discussions
- Back-and-forth conversations 
- Questions and answers
- Personal opinions of members
- Lengthy explanations

Format your response like formal action minutes:

1. CALL TO ORDER (time, who called it) [seg_X]
2. ROLL CALL/ATTENDANCE (who was present) [seg_X-Y]
3. For each agenda item:
   a. Item title and very brief description [seg_X-Y]
   b. If a presentation occurred, note who presented [seg_X-Y] (without presentation details)
   c. For public comments, simply note if there were any and who spoke [seg_X-Y]
   d. For actions: "Motion By [Name] [seg_X], Second By [Name] [seg_X], To [action]"
   e. Vote results: "Motion [approved/failed] ([vote count])" [seg_X-Y]

The minutes should be official-looking, sparse, and focused only on actions and decisions made during the meeting, not on discussions or deliberations. Always include segment references for verification.
