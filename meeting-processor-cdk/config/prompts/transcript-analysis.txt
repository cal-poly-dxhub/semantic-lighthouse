Go through this transcript for a board meeting. The context of the board meeting should be clear from the agenda and the transcript.
I want you to go through this and look for the segments where there is a vote taking place or where there is a topic transition.
Refer to the agenda for more info:

AGENDA:
{agenda}

TRANSCRIPT:
{formatted_transcript}

I want you to reference specific segments for topic transitions, segments where a vote takes place, which segments refer to which agenda item, etc. Please also mention what each agenda item is about and what the vote was about. Also include what discussions were had about each agenda item and other information. Be very thorough in the discussion of each agenda item and the vote. Be sure to include what things were discussed, debated etc in detail.
Please be EXTREMELY comprehensive and specific in your analysis, always referencing segment IDs when discussing parts of the transcript. For the references i want you to use the format [seg_0] or [seg_0-55] if using a range of segments.
